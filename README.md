## Overview

This project focuses on automating the collection, processing, and storage of solar generation forecast data. The aim is to provide a consistent and reliable data source for further analysis. Through teamwork and collaboration, we successfully automated the entire data pipeline, ensuring efficiency, reliability, and data integrity.

## Key Project Steps

### Collection

We developed a Python script that automatically downloads 48 hours' worth of solar generation forecast data at 6 am daily. This ensures a consistent and reliable data source for our analysis. 

### Processing

To ensure data accuracy and cleanliness, we implemented robust data processing procedures. We thoroughly checked for errors and performed necessary cleanup steps to prepare the data for the subsequent storage phase.

### Storage

We utilized Google BigQuery as our database solution. Additionally, we developed a custom scraping tool that seamlessly appends the cleaned data to the database every day at the predefined time. This establishes a centralized and accessible repository for further analysis.

## Conclusion

This capstone project provided us with valuable experience in Python scripting, data management, and automation. We gained hands-on exposure to real-world data challenges and utilized industry-standard tools for efficient data handling.

Feel free to explore the repository and provide any feedback or suggestions. We hope this project serves as a valuable resource for others interested in automating data collection, processing, and storage.
